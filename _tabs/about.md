# Colors

## What's this all about

Colors are super interesting and there's so much to them! 
Although this site is only to showcase the most popular colors (and by that I mean: the most popular favourite colors)
below you can find some topics you may want to read more about later.

### Your favourite color

Have you ever wondered about why do you have a favourite color?
Why is it what it is and how come you even assosiate emotions with it?

Color psychology is an amazing topic. It assosiates emotions with colors and
finds a special bond between those two. 

Color is a powerful communication tool and can be used to signal action, influence mood, and even influence physiological reactions. Certain colors have been associated with physiological changes, including increased blood pressure, increased metabolism, and eyestrain.

### Colors that heal you

Colorology is still used today as a holistic or alternative treatment

In this treatment:

- **Red** is used to stimulate the body and mind and to increase circulation.

- **Yellow** is thought to stimulate the nerves and purify the body.

- **Orange** is used to heal the lungs and to increase energy levels.

- **Blue** is believed to soothe illnesses and treat pain.

- **Indigo** shades are thought to alleviate skin problems.

### Chromesthesia 

Sound-to-color synesthesia is a type of synesthesia (phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway) in which sound involuntarily evokes an experience of color, shape, and movement.Individuals with sound-color synesthesia are consciously aware of their synesthetic color associations/perceptions in daily life.
